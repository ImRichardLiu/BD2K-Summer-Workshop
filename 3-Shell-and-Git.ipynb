In contrast a graphical user interface (GUI) may be more convenient to use, but you have less control in how you use the software. Also, most cutting-edge research tools are first developed for command line interfaces. \n",

The most popular shell is called bash, but other popular shells include zsh, csh, and tcsh. We are going to use bash here, but I recommend trying out zsh. The shell is started in a terminal emulator and how you start your terminal session depends on your operating system.

    "The manual page for **ls** can be found using this command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "man ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can search the manual page by typing / and then a search term. Try searching for what -h does by typing /-h and hitting enter. You can move the cursor to the next instance of the search term by typing n. Shift-N searches in the reverse direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important command is **cd** - change directory. First, let's go to the root of the filesystem. This can be done using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /\n",

To make your own working copy of the repository, **fork** it by clicking the fork button. Now you own a copy of the repo you can download and make changes to. To download your workshop repo go to the terminal session that is connected to the remote server and type in this command:\n",

    "git clone https://url/to/your/repo\n",
